If you find yourself thinking about it too much, feel free to join the Church Of Holy Spazkinism. We could use the new bodies. Here is the invite code: 3RNGfSe SpazOS contains whatever I feel neccesary and doesn't realy follow a set plan. He's kinda a grab bag of commands and odd respones. If you would like to add some code to SpazOS, I would love you forever! I will, of course, attribute the code to you. Feel whatever code sections catches your fancy, just make sure you attribute the code to me, Minaro. Thanks! I am a newbie programmer, and this is the first time I've used GitHub. If my code looks weird or if I do odd things on GitHub, it's probably because I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm learning :D",
